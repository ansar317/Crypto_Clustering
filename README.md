## Introduction

Cryptocurrencies have become a significant aspect of the financial landscape. This project leverages data science techniques to cluster cryptocurrencies, providing a deeper understanding of their characteristics and potential market behavior.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebooks (optional but recommended for interactive exploration)
- Required dependencies (specified in `requirements.txt`)

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Dataset

The project uses a cryptocurrency dataset obtained from [Repo]. Ensure that you have the dataset downloaded and organized properly before running the notebooks.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Explore the dataset through detailed EDA notebooks. Understand the features, distributions, and potential patterns in the data.

## Clustering

Apply clustering algorithms to group cryptocurrencies based on their features. Experiment with different algorithms and hyperparameters to find the most meaningful clusters.

## Results

Discover valuable insights from the clustering results. Visualize the clusters and analyze the characteristics of cryptocurrencies within each group.

## Usage

Follow the Jupyter Notebooks in the `notebooks` directory for a step-by-step guide on EDA, clustering, and result interpretation.

```bash
# Example notebook usage
jupyter notebook notebooks/EDA.ipynb
```

## Dependencies

List of dependencies can be found in the `requirements.txt` file. Install them using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
